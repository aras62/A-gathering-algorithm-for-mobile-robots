# A-gathering-algorithm-for-mobile-robots
This is a simulation of the gathering algorithm for a swarm of autonomous mobile robots proposed in [" Fault-Tolerant Algorithms for Autonomous Mobile Robots"](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=982951) by Agmon and Peleg. The code is implemented in C++.

This is a distributed algorithm which allows a group of robots, which are aware of each others' positions, to converge to a common point. The algorithm is robust to the presence of faulty (Byzantine) robots, who perform random actions in the environment.
